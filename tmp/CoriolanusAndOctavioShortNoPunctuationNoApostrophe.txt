First Citizen
Before we proceed any further hear me speak

All
Speak speak

First Citizen
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish

All
Resolved resolved

First Citizen
First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people

All
We know t we know t

First Citizen
Let us kill him and we ll have corn at our own price
Is t a verdict

All
No more talking on t let it be done away away

Second Citizen
One word good citizens

First Citizen
We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they
would yield us but the superfluity while it were
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
but they think we are too dear the leanness that
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge

Second Citizen
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius

All
Against him first he s a very dog to the commonalty

Second Citizen
Consider you what services he has done for his country

First Citizen
Very well and could be content to give him good
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud

Second Citizen
Nay but speak not maliciously

First Citizen
I say unto you what he hath done famously he did
it to that end though soft conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue

Second Citizen
What he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous

First Citizen
If I must not I need not be barren of accusations
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
What shouts are these The other side o the city
is risen why stay we prating here to the Capitol

All
Come come

First Citizen
Soft who comes here

Second Citizen
Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved
the people

First Citizen
He s one honest enough would all the rest were so

MENENIUS
What work s my countrymen in hand where go you
With bats and clubs The matter speak I pray you

First Citizen
Our business is not unknown to the senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
which now we ll show em in deeds They say poor
suitors have strong breaths they shall know we
have strong arms too

MENENIUS
Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
Will you undo yourselves

First Citizen
We cannot sir we are undone already

MENENIUS
I tell you friends most charitable care
Have the patricians of you For your wants
Your suffering in this dearth you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state whose course will on
The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment For the dearth
The gods not the patricians make it and
Your knees to them not arms must help Alack
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you and you slander
The helms o the state who care for you like fathers
When you curse them as enemies

First Citizen
Care for us True indeed They ne er cared for us
yet suffer us to famish and their store houses
crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
the poor If the wars eat us not up they will and
there s all the love they bear us

MENENIUS
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious
Or be accused of folly I shall tell you
A pretty tale it may be you have heard it
But since it serves my purpose I will venture
To stale t a little more

First Citizen
Well I ll hear it sir yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please
you deliver

MENENIUS
There was a time when all the body s members
Rebell d against the belly thus accused it
That only like a gulf it did remain
I the midst o the body idle and unactive
Still cupboarding the viand never bearing
Like labour with the rest where the other instruments
Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
And mutually participate did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body The belly answer d

First Citizen
Well sir what answer made the belly

MENENIUS
Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile
Which ne er came from the lungs but even thus
For look you I may make the belly smile
As well as speak it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you

First Citizen
Your belly s answer What
The kingly crowned head the vigilant eye
The counsellor heart the arm our soldier
Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric if that they

MENENIUS
What then
Fore me this fellow speaks What then what then

First Citizen
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain d
Who is the sink o the body

MENENIUS
Well what then

First Citizen
The former agents if they did complain
What could the belly answer

MENENIUS
I will tell you
If you ll bestow a small of what you have little
Patience awhile you ll hear the belly s answer

First Citizen
Ye re long about it

MENENIUS

The multiple life of Octavio Hornada

Chapter One Octavio s Childhood


Octavio was born in Lima Peru His birth mother must have been too poor to avoid pregnancy and to raise him 
He was found in a basket on a bench at Parque de Amor the Park of Love the strip of grass in Miraflores that tops the cliffs facing the Pacific Ocean
Perhaps his mother hoped her baby would be discovered by a jogger or one of these rich women practicing Thai Chi at the crack of dawn
She had just left the basket with a tag on it Octavio Hornada 
What a strange name Octavio Perhaps this was her eighth child and she could not find another more intimately personal name
Or perhaps she knew she would have to let him go And why did she leave a last name Why just one last name
Was it his father s name and she would not give hers A name is such an obvious cue
The social worker or the police would interrogate potential relatives of people named Hornada
It would necessarily lead to her
But it was not easy The police did look the name up Hornada is not common
The investigation could not find who could have abandoned the infant
This last name lead nowhere
The inquiry did take a long time though So the name stuck

The morning he was discovered the paragliding instructor was setting up
It was about 10 30 The ocean breeze was slowly dissipating the morning fog
It was smooth and already getting strong Straight in
Just what you need to soar the buildings It was going to be a beautiful flight on a sunny Autumn day
Are you flying with us today he shouted to a brunette who was walking towards him 
Yes she answered You are very lucky today he said more softly as she was now at his level
We ve got a nice ocean wind coming straight in We are going to fly high today
Have you signed the waiver papers She nodded Do you know how to run
I want you to give it all you got  He made her run a few times and then showed her how to put on the harness
The breeze died down for a moment That s when she heard him the baby 

Maybe it was the shouting or maybe he was hungry 
She asked the instructor Do you know what this is It does not sound like a cat Let me look  

Chapter Two Mitsuko Batchi


Chapter Three Basheer Patel s interview with Pr Geoff Sutsbencuns

Musical introduction
B Patel 
Welcome to our online podcast The Hessian
It is an honor to have one of the most prolific contributors to the field of Artificial Intelligence with us today
So I want to first take this opportunity to thank you Professor Sutsbencuns You are a familiar figure to our audience and hardly need an introduction
You were one of the co inventors of the backpropagation algorithm that now powers most of AI one of the pioneers of Language Models and directed the Wide Open AI project that developed the Ground Grinding Ginormous Gorgeous Prediction Tantalizer otherwise known as 4GPT
So rather than me attempting to paraphrase what you could tell us I would be delighted to hear from you how all these ideas came about
So without further due Professor tell us about these AI milestones

Geoff Sutsbencuns 
It is interesting to see the billions of dollars now pouring into AI because when we started we could not get published 

It s all about representations
Say you start with an image a grid of pixels these small dots right next to each other that can take any degree of grayness between black and white zero is for black 1 for white
So this image is like a long list of numbers we call it a vector if you list each dot value left to right for each line and put each line one after the other
You want to represent this input image
So you use many units we sometimes call them neurons hence the term neural network
Each has a particular feature it tries to find in the input say a line of a given shape at a given place in the image
If it found it it turns on if not it stays off Or rather it turns on more or less depending on how much what it finds resembles its feature
So if you look at your long list of units you get another long list of dots on or off or in between a representation of the image
It is easier to think of it if you break down the list in lines and put the lines under each other but it does not matter the list of numbers the vector itself is the representation 
You can keep going like this use the representation made by your list of units as an input to another layer of units trying to find their features in the representation
This new layer of units becomes then a representation of the representation of the input image


That sounds easy but back in the 1980s all these unit features had to be hand crafted
We were trying to find a way to automatically train a neural network to give us a desired output representation given its matching input using a series of model examples for training a batch of examples
For testing we have to use examples different from the ones used for training although of the same kind
We build such a network that learned to match the handwritten image of a digit you just wrote to its actual value by training it before on a batch of similar examples

B Patel 
Forgive me Professor for interrupting I suppose you are talking about the stochastic gradient descent algorithm the engine of AI our audience uses on a daily basis in their work and which is so familiar to them that it goes without saying

Geoff Sutsbencuns 
That s why it goes even goes better saying it

B Patel Go ahead professor so much for not paraphrasing

Geoff Sutsbencuns 
There was already a procedure to do it with networks with only one layer of units These guys would get all the publications But we wanted to do it with two or more layers
You see there is only so much you can map with only one layer of units
Suppose you want one of these units to turn on when it sees only the right portion of a line and also on when it is only the left portion
But you want it to be off when it sees both portions You cannot do this with one layer of units but you can do it with two
